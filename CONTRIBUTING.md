#Contributing

Contributing is welcome, you can report bugs, write documentation, submit pull requests or ask questions.
When submitting pull requests, make sure to run all tests and lint by running `yarn test`. Every pull request must have a well written description saying the purpose of the pull request and must have extensive tests. I will analyze and comment as I can, but rest assured I will view all of them.

Good subjects to contribute are:
* Writing more tests
* Answering questions
* Add support to other cloud providers (Google Cloud Function, Azure Functions etc.)
* Writing better documentation and examples
* Core middleware functions with broad use cases
